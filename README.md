ðŸ“– How It Works

1.The JavaScript listens to user input and validates each field on every key press.
2.When you click the submit button:
  1.It checks if each field is filled.
  2.It tests the field content against specific regular expressions:
      1.Names only allow alphabets.
      2.Email should match standard email format.
      3.Password requires minimum length and complexity.
3.If any validation fails, it shows error messages and highlights the input box in red.
4.Password field has a toggle button to show/hide the password.
5.If all inputs are valid, the user is redirected to a success page confirming account creation.
